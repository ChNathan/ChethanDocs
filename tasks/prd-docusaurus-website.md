# Product Requirements Document: Personal Docusaurus Website

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the development of a personal Docusaurus-based website that serves as a professional portfolio and personal journal platform. The website will showcase work projects, travel experiences, and blog posts in a clean, documentation-style format similar to Backyard Brains and SEEED Studio. The primary goal is to create a minimalist, easily maintainable platform that can be shared with employers and friends to demonstrate professional capabilities and personal interests.

## Goals

1. **Professional Showcase**: Create a platform to display work projects and technical documentation that appeals to potential employers
2. **Personal Expression**: Provide a space for travel journals and personal blog posts to share with friends
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Ensure the site can be manually updated without complex workflows
4. **Version Control**: Maintain full version history through GitHub for easy rollbacks and design reviews
5. **Clean Design**: Implement a minimalist, professional layout with intuitive navigation
6. **Reliable Hosting**: Deploy on GitHub Pages for consistent availability

## User Stories

1. **As a potential employer**, I want to browse through well-organized project documentation so that I can assess the candidate's technical skills and communication abilities.

2. **As a friend**, I want to read travel journals and personal posts so that I can stay connected and see what adventures are happening.

3. **As the site owner**, I want to easily add new content through simple markdown files so that I can focus on writing rather than technical maintenance.

4. **As a site visitor**, I want clear navigation with organized categories so that I can quickly find the type of content I'm interested in.

5. **As the site owner**, I want to push changes to GitHub and see them reflected on the live site so that I can review updates and maintain version control.

### Technical Success Criteria
1. **Performance**: Site loads in under 3 seconds on standard connections
2. **Usability**: Navigation structure allows visitors to find content within 2 clicks
3. **Maintenance**: Content updates can be made and deployed within 10 minutes
4. **Version Control**: Ability to revert to any previous version within 5 minutes

## Open Questions

1. **Content Migration**: Do you have existing content that needs to be migrated to the new site?
2. **Category Structure**: What should the three main sidebar categories be named? (e.g., "Work Projects", "Travel", "Blog" or similar)
3. **Initial Content**: Do you want placeholder content for testing, or should we start with a minimal structure?
4. **Logo Timeline**: When might you want to add a logo, and should we reserve space for it in the design?
5. **Analytics**: Would basic GitHub Pages analytics be sufficient for now, or do you need Google Analytics setup?
